# vue3-select

This is a forked and maintained version of
[sagalbot/vue-select](https://github.com/sagalbot/vue-select), which is no
longer maintained. As the name suggests, this project is specifically designed
to work with the Vue 3.

**Notes**: At the moment, most of the features of vue3-select are the same as
the original vue-select project. As such, users can refer to the original
documentation for usage instructions.
